On Monday, the DATA-science team met—late, of course. Notes read: "Clean the logs; normalise_text; remove stop-words; keep numbers like 5.99 and 1,234." Meanwhile, ducks_and-unicorns kept appearing in test-data—strange, right? The catalog listed CAT, scatter, and concatenate, but only cat should count as an animal. IDs: A123, B99, C4567; ref: 2025-09-13. Room 101; Floor-5; ext. 0042. Quotes: “Don’t over-fit,” said the mentor, “and don’t under_fit either!” Whitespace   happens.  So-do—em—dashes, ellipses... and emojis 🦄🙂. Email: test.user+spam@example.com; URL: https://example.org/path?x=1&y=2. Last line: Re-run, re-check, re-do; then ship_it, roll-back (if needed), and celebrate—quietly.
